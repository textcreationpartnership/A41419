            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>SINCE <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Caeſar</hi> has given us Peace, let us enjoy it. Why ſhould any be any longer Miſerable, when a Univerſal Bleſſing bids all be Happy? We have had enough of Perſecution, enough of Sequeſtring, of Seizing, of Confinements, of Priſons; enough of ſtarving, of undoing Families, of Tortuning Conſciences and making Orphans and Widows for God's ſake. Theſe have been the Evils We have hitherto groan'd under, and which have for many years deform'd Our <hi>Goſhen</hi> with an <hi>Egyptian Servitude.</hi> But now, Heaven be Bleſs'd, and Thanks to Our Good Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign, we are call'd from this Slavery; theſe Heavy Burdens are taken off our Shoulders; We need no

longer dread the <hi>Black Writ,</hi> or <hi>a Summons;</hi> but may every one ſit under his own Fig-tree, and eat of the Fruit of his own Vine. Away therefore now with all <hi>Animoſities</hi> and <hi>Hatreds,</hi> let <hi>Jealouſies</hi> and <hi>Plotting</hi> be baniſh'd from amongſt us, let <hi>Factions</hi> and <hi>Riots</hi> be buried for ever; and let an Undiſtinguiſhing Charity unite us equally to every Neighbour. Let us have no other <hi>Teſt,</hi> but of <hi>Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty</hi> and <hi>Love.</hi> Let every one Serve God to the beſt of his Knowledge: And tho' we cannot <hi>joyn</hi> in <hi>Worſhip,</hi> yet let no <hi>Hatred</hi> divide us. Let <hi>Chriſtians</hi> dread nothing, but from <hi>Infidels</hi> or <hi>Turks:</hi> If <hi>theſe</hi> are taught to hate us, to Revile and Rail a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us; if theſe have their <hi>Chains,</hi> their <hi>Priſons</hi> and their <hi>Slavery;</hi> Let theſe <hi>Turkiſh Entertainments</hi> remain with the <hi>Turks:</hi> For why ſhould <hi>Chriſtians</hi> prepare them for one another? Let us all joyn our Hearts and our Hands, to purge the Nation of theſe <hi>Barbary-Faſhions:</hi> And let <hi>Railing</hi> and <hi>Reproching</hi> be no longer any part of Our Religion; Theſe may ſound well enough in a <hi>Moſch;</hi> But make no good Muſick within <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Walls: Let the <hi>Teſt</hi> of a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> be no other than what was appointed by <hi>Chriſt.</hi> He Commanded us to <hi>Love one another:</hi> Let us all take This <hi>Teſt,</hi> This <hi>Chriſtian Teſt.</hi> In this let us ſtrive to out do one another: And let this be the chief Argument, by which we deſire to prove, that <hi>We are Chriſt's Diſciples.</hi> Oh! what a Happy Nation would This <hi>Charity</hi> make us? How ſoon would <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Plenty</hi> begin to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow? How would our Neighbours abroad both Love and admire us? How would our Enemies ſwell both with Envy and Dread? And why now

ſhall we not be thus Happy, when we may? If we hinder it not our ſelves, our <hi>Guardian-Caeſar</hi> will not permit it to be in the Power of others to do it. Let us apply therefore our Minds to the Promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this Union: Let us all endeavour to mend every one One. Let us all ſearch our <hi>Inclinations,</hi> and examine our <hi>Hearts;</hi> if any one diſcovers there any <hi>Sowerneſs</hi> or <hi>Averſion</hi> to <hi>Peace;</hi> if any <hi>Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly</hi> ariſing at this <hi>General Joy:</hi> Let him purge and diſcharge it: Such Symptoms betray a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of Humours, and that the <hi>Conſtitution</hi> is not ſo <hi>Chriſtian</hi> as it ſhou'd be. If any <hi>Grieve,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>This Peace</hi> has leſſen'd their <hi>Authority,</hi> or ſhortned their <hi>Power;</hi> let them examine, what this <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> was: If 'twas a Power of <hi>Perſecuting,</hi> a Power of <hi>Oppreſſing,</hi> a Power of <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting</hi> their <hi>Neighbour;</hi> let them Remember, that to a Good Man ſuch a <hi>loſs</hi> is deſirable, and that <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny</hi> is no proper Badge of a <hi>Chriſtian.</hi> If any find an Inclination to be <hi>Railing</hi> againſt their <hi>Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours;</hi> if they can never think themſelves well, but when they are Trampling upon their Fellow-Chriſtians; if they recommend their <hi>Perſwaſion,</hi> by making others <hi>Ridiculous;</hi> this may paſs for a <hi>Zeal,</hi> but ſcarce according to <hi>Knowledge;</hi> This might do well enough, were it the Intereſt of Chriſtians to deſtroy Chriſtianity; were there any vertue in <hi>Paſſion,</hi> in <hi>Animoſity,</hi> and <hi>Malice;</hi> or were it our <hi>Duty</hi> to <hi>Hate,</hi> inſtead of <hi>Love</hi> one another. But as our Goſpel ſtands, <hi>Meekneſs, Charity, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion</hi> and <hi>Peace,</hi> are the better Vertues, and more Subſtantial Proofs of a good Religion. Since our Goſpel therefore is a Goſpel of <hi>Peace,</hi> let us improve

this vertue amongſt us: And for all Snarling, Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling, Unneighbourly Tempers, let them be gone into <hi>Cadmus</hi>'s Field, where Fighting is all the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion; where no Man gets up, but tis to knock down his Neighbour, where Ruin is all the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign. This is the proper place of ſuch embitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Spirits; here let them fire all their <hi>Mouth-Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nados,</hi> and beat up their Points of War upon <hi>Pulpit-Drums:</hi> But for us, let us live in Peace, we deſire no ſuch <hi>Champain Divinity.</hi> Our Goſpel inſtructs us to <hi>Serve God,</hi> to <hi>Give Caeſar his Due,</hi> and to <hi>Love our Neighbour;</hi> let this be our Profeſſion and our Practice. Let thoſe be admir'd, who encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage theſe Vertues and Teach them. But for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers who either openly, or by Sly Inſinuations promote the contrary, let them be eſteem'd neither for Good Chriſtians or Loyal Subjects.</p>
